      <h2>How To Perform Some Common Bodyweight Exercises!</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>1. How To Do Push-ups</h3>  
      <br>
      <p>Muscles Involved: Arms, shoulders, chest, core</p>
      <br>  
      <p>Technique: Put your feet and hands on the floor. Keep your body in a straight line without drooping in the middle. 
      Your arms are the only body parts not keeping in a line. Keeping your core tight, push yourself away from the ground 
      while keeping your shoulders close to your torso. Once your arms are fully extended, lower yourself back down to the ground
      to complete one repetition.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>2. How To Do Squats</h3>  
      <br>
      <p>Muscles Involved: Lower body, mainly quadriceps and gluteus maximus</p>
      <br>  
      <p>Technique: Stand with your arms out, perpendicular to your body. Position your feet roughly shoulder-width apart. 
      Lower yourself into a crouch so that your hamstrings and calves touch. Then lift yourself back up, maintaining 
      outstretched arms to complete one repetition.</p>
      <br><br> 
      <h3>3. How To Do Sit-ups</h3>  
      <br>
      <p>Muscles Involved: Abdominal muscles</p>
      <br>
      <p>Technique: Note that doing sit-ups on a hard floor may hurt your tailbone, so padding such as a mat 
      may be helpful. Lie face-up with bent knees and feet flat on the ground. Cross your arms on your chest.
      Engaging your core, lift your back off the ground using your abdominal muscles to sit up. Lower yourself 
      back to the ground to complete one repetition.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>4. How To Do The Plank</h3>  
      <br>
      <p>Muscles Involved: Abdominal muscles, core muscles</p>
      <br>  
      <p>Technique: Facing down on the ground, keep your body in a straight line, 
        with your toes and forearms touching the ground and keeping you elevated. Engage your abdominal 
        muscles and hold the position for a set amount of seconds (e.g., 10-60 seconds) depending
        on your ability.
