# Free Home Exercise

This website is titled 'Free Home Exercise'. The purpose of this website is to teach its users about the benefits of trying out bodyweight exercise as opposed to weight training. The site's target demographic is people who do not have enough money to buy a gym membership or expensive home exercise equipment, and for people seeking a minimalist exercise option. The site will provide users with a concise source of information on the subject of bodyweight exercise.
