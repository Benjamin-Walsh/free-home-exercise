# Free Home Exercise

This website is titled 'Free Home Exercise'. The purpose of this website is to teach its users about the benefits of trying out bodyweight exercise as opposed to weight training. The site's target demographic is people who do not have enough money to buy a gym membership or expensive home exercise equipment, and for people seeking a minimalist exercise option. The site will provide users with a concise source of information on the subject of bodyweight exercise.

## Features

### Existing Features

-__The Home Page__

    -The home page explains what bodyweight exercise is, and the benefits of bodyweight exercise,
    through short paragraphs.
    -The page serves as a useful resource for users, synopsizing the concept of bodyweight
    exercise into simple points.  
    -The page features a hero image depicting someone exercising, which is meant to signal the theme 
    of the website and inspires viewers.
    -Icons displayed next to section headings help communicate the purpose of each section. 
    -The home page contains an embedded YouTube video which helps to explain what bodyweight
    exercise is and what the benefits are.

-__The Header__

    -The header is common to all three pages. It helps provide a consistent layout which reduces visual confusion.
    -The header has a menu icon on the right which displays a navigation menu when clicked.
    -When hovered over, the menu icon turns white to help communicate that it is a button.
    -The currently active page is coloured differently in the nav menu to help orient the user on the site.
    -The header is coloured differently to the main section of the page to help users find their way easily around the website
    by following the design convention of distinct headers.

-__The Footer__

    -The footer contains icons of social media logos, and clicking on them opens a new tab with the corresponding social media.
    -If there were social media accounts created for this project, these links would help tie together my online presence
    and help users learn more and stay up-to-date on what I'm doing. 
    -There is a message in the footer informing users that the website is purely for educational purposes so that someone who
    might find the site would not be confused as to why it does not behave quite the same as professional sites.
    -The footer is coloured differently to the main section of the page to help direct users' attention in a conventional way 
    which helps users find their way easily around the website.

-__Exercise Guide Page__

    -The main content heading effectively explains the purpose of the page.
    -This page contains a simple guide for four different exercises.
    -Each exercise section explains what muscles are involved in each to help users find what they need.
    -Each section also explains the proper technique for doing each exercise so that users can get started 
    straight away without the need for further research.

-__Mailing-list Page__

    -This page contains a form for users to input some basic information to sign up for a (hypothetical) mailing-list.
    -The layout is simple and uncluttered so as not to put people off from engaging. 
    -There is a disclaimer that the form is not connected to an actual mailing list just in case.
    -There is an image of a man performing an impressive exercise to motivate users to get involved.

### Future Features To Implement

    -I would like to implement media queries for further responsive design.
    -I would like to make the nav icon switch to full words when there is enough space on the screen.
    -I would like to add more exercises to the Exercise guide page.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

-__HTML__

I used the W3 html validator. For the index, I got an obselete frameborder notice for iframe and warning about br elements in a list, so i fixed the errors.
The exercise guide page had no errors. For the mailing list page I was warned that auto was a bad height value for an img element, so I changed it.

-__CSS__

### Unfixed Bugs

## Deployment

I deployed my website to GitHub Pages through the following procedure.

    -I went to the settings tab in my project repository on GitHub.
    
    -In the list on the left hand side of the settings page, 
     under the 'Code and automation' heading, I clicked on the 'Pages'
     section.
     
    -In the Github Pages section, under the 'Build and deployment' heading,
     I clicked on the branch dropdown menu.
     
    -I selected the main project branch and root folder, and then saved
     my choices.
     
    -Upon saving, a deployment was created which can be accessed by
     going to the code tab of the github repository and navigating to 
     the deployments section in the list on the right.
